My disgusting log of the horrible things i put myself through (To chris)

Dont look at the code, its a mess, its not a text adventure, its not what you asked for, im sorry.
However what you do have is something that after days of work, works.
No shortcuts could be taken as each possibility has slightly different adjustments, either to the maths or the text.
This was a stupid idea, and i knew it early on, however i refused to make a generic 
boring text game where the player is not immersed in whats happeneing.
I hope my 'game' does that, makes you somewhat feel like what you are doing means something, even if that something is the
player getting angry after losing the first hand.
Maybe a new player learns something and wants to endulge themself in a new activity, or a returning player that, through
play of my game, gets a rekindling of wanting to play poker again, actually i dont care, ive only done 1 hand, you wanted 
like 5 rooms which i was trying to equate to 5 hands, but hand one, on its own took days....(being about 600 lines before christmas
and doing a couple of hours per day since)
Im whining, im going to shut up 
it really do be like that.
